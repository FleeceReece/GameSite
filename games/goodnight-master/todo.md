# TO-DO
* Check if gamepad is plugged in at start of level 1. If not, swap the tutorial text to say 'press X' instead of 'press A'. Also update level 6 ('press B to chill').
* Add some music/FX when the dreamer falls asleep in the opening credits.
* Show stats at end of game (somewhere?).
* Change the death player body rotation.
* Clean up index.js.
* Release on Steam.

## ACHIEVEMENTS
* Zero Chill: Finish the game with a 0-second chill record.
* Stop & Smell: Pick every flower in the game.
* Exterminator/Ruthlezz/Cold-Blooded: Kill every znake in the game. (Except the impossible ones.)
* Deathproof: Never die. "If you die in your dreams, do you die in real life? You'll never know."
* Knievel: Jump the gorge 20 times without dying.
* Greatnight: Qualify for Zero Chill, Stop & Smell, Cold-Blooded, Deathproof, and Knievel achievements in a single run.
* Allergic: Avoid all the flowers.
* Pazifizt: Don't kill any snakes.

# KNOWN BUGS
* DEV: If you put walls in front of znakes, they will walk through them (so I don't).
* Sometimes the player animation glitches when climbing at the top of the chain.
* Auto-swimming seems not to always work.
